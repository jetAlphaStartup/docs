# POS API

The POS (Point of Sale) API provides endpoints for retrieving products in a store's inventory. This API is designed for point-of-sale systems to quickly search and access product information.

<Note>
All POS API endpoints require the `x-store-id` header to identify which store's products you want to access.
</Note>

## Endpoint Details

**Base URL:** `https://jethings-backend.fly.dev`  
**Content-Type:** `application/json`

### Required Headers

```
x-store-id: <store_id>

<Warning>
The `x-store-id` header is required for all POS endpoints. Requests without this header will be rejected.

## Business Logic

### Store Context
- All product queries are scoped to the store specified in the `x-store-id` header
- The store ID must be valid and the user must have access to that store
- Products from other stores are not accessible through this endpoint

### Search Functionality
- The search parameter filters products across multiple fields (e.g., barcode, name, reference)
- Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matching
- If no search parameter is provided, all products in the store are returned (with pagination)

### Pagination
- Results are paginated by default
- Default page size is 10 items per page
- Use pagination metadata to navigate through results
