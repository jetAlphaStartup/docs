Welcome to the **Auth API** documentation. This API provides comprehensive authentication and user management features for frontend engineers integrating authentication flows.

### Base URL

The base URL for all API requests depends on your environment:

**Production:**
```
https://api.example.com
```

**Development:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Content Type

All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

### Important Notes

- **JSON Responses**: All responses are returned in JSON format
- **Error Handling**: Errors follow standard HTTP status codes with `{ message: string }` body
- **Success Responses**: Unless noted, successful responses return `200 OK`
- **Authentication**: Some endpoints require Bearer token authentication

### Example

For all API requests, make sure to use the appropriate base URL:

```shell
# Development
POST http://localhost:3000/auth/signup

# Production  
POST https://api.example.com/auth/signup
```

### Support
