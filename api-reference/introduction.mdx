title: "API Introduction"
---

Welcome to the **Jethings API** documentation. This API enables you to interact with various features, including user management, email verification, and more.

### Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is:

```
https://api.jethings.com
```

### Important Notes

- **Cold Start Delays**: Since the API is hosted on a serverless platform with a three-tier architecture, the first request after a period of inactivity might take up to **60 seconds** to process. This is due to the cold start time of the underlying infrastructure. Subsequent requests should be much faster.

- **Error Reporting**: If you encounter any issues with the API, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. We actively monitor the issue tracker and will address reported problems as soon as possible.

### Example

For all API requests, make sure to use the following base URL:

```shell
GET https://api.jethings.com/your-endpoint
```

### Support

If you have any questions, suggestions, or bugs to report, please open an issue on GitHub at:

```

```

Thank you for using the Jethings API!
